<h2>P-Tourist</h2>
P-Tourist is an application with images, maps, information, and user authorization.

<h2>Technical stuff</h2>
First of all, this application is built on <i>Ruby on Rails</i> and <i>AngularJS</i>. It also uses AngularJS libraries and Bootstrap on the frontend. On the backend it uses both PostgreSQL and MongoDB databases.

See a visual architecture in the picture below: <br>

Currently it is deployed on Heroku. As at the moment it's demonstration and not commercial app (you don't see any ads, isn't it?), here is used free account.
